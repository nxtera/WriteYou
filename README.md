## What was my motivation?
To dive straight into backend development and demonstrate my knowledge using node.js to create a very useful application that I, myself will use in all future projects.
 

## What did I do?
Used knowledge gained on node.js from the past week in Bootcamp to expand on the starter code to ensure the app had the relevant functionality that meets the user criteria. I had to use the professional readme guide to ensure the I prompted the user for the information that would output a quality README that meets industry standards.


## What did I learn?
- How to programme a command line application using Node.js.
- How to use the inquirer package. 
- How to generate a high quality, professional README.


## Usage
Required Information:
- Name of the Project
- Description of the project?
- Instructions and examples for use of the project
- Steps required to install the project
- How  others can contribute to the project
- The test information
- The type of license required
- Github handle?",  
- What is your email address?

### Installation
1) Start by initializing the app using  

``` 
node index
```
2) Answer the command line questions with the information you wish to populate the README with.
